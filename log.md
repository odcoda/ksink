## 2026-01-05 initial setup

Set up tools repo inspired by Simon Willison's approach:
- Created CLAUDE.md with custom instructions for Python and HTML tools
- Added index.html listing page with purple gradient header
- Created sample tools:
  - `tools/html/gravity-balls.html` - physics sim with bouncing balls
  - `tools/python/excuse.py` - random developer excuse generator
- Created GitHub repo and enabled Pages
